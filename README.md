In order to configure and add agents we will need to go through Admin Panel -> Agents -> Add New

We can use whatever names we want for example Jane Dough. We can then set there username, password and job status such as their department and permissions.

and we can use whatever names we want here as well.

</p>
<p>
In order to configure SLA's we will need to go to the Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA

From here we can create a new SLA plan and call it SEV-A for example. This will allow us to set up a rule that we can follow in order to prioritize tcikets that we may receive.

We can set up a grace period that gives us a idea of how long you will have to fulfill the ticket. Then also setup a schedule to to see if a timeframe of availability will matter for the ticket.

</p>
<p>
In order to configure Help Topics we will need to go to Admin Panel -> Manage -> Help Topics

and then create new.

From here we can create topics that users can choose to label the issue they may be having.

For example we can choose Business Critcal Outage and make it a top level topic so its severity can be properly expressed.
